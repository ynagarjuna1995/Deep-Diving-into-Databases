<h3 id="using-xampp-on-windows">Using XAMPP on windows</h3>

<p>other alternatives being existed in order to avoid the the  confusion I prefer using XAMPP. Feel free to use any database installation (Postgres,SQLite) or MySQL workbench installation.</p>

<p>Since XAMPP is self contained independent installation we cannot run it directly in command prompt by </p>

<pre><code>&gt;  mysql
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throws Error :  <br>
  C:\Users\UserName&gt;mysql <br>
         ‘mysql’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, <br>
          operable program or batch file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is mainly because MySQL executable is not in our system path which comes with XAMPP installation as I mentioned is an independent environment which is entirely isolated with your System Variable </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Don’t worry about system variables and System Paths.) Those are merely not useful as of now </p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="how-to-start-using-mysql-installation-then">How to start using MySQL installation then ?</h3>

<p>Well there is an easy way on Windows every program need to have an executable file in order to use. So lets find where the MySQL’s executable resides which came with the XAMPP installation.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the below mentioned you can find mysql binary executable  <br>
  Note : For every program you encounter problem you will have to find the executable files ending with .exe in order run it.On windows normally all the programs resides in <code>c:/Program Files/</code> </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>c:/xampp/mysql/bin/</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Now </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>mysql -u root</code> </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Here 2 things need to keep in mind is that you may get the error as shown below </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' (10061)</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This is mainly because with normal MySQL installation <code>mysqld.exe</code> will run automatically but here while using XAMPP we need to manually start it A simple way of doing it is by just following the below steps</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Open XAMPP Control Panel</li>
  <li>Press <strong><em>START</em></strong>  button </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>and then run </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>mysql -u root <br>
    </code>Since where -u means <em>usename</em>  and root is the name of user or username <br>
    Some may suggest doing running  <br>
    <code>mysql -u root -p</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Since XAMPP MySQL default installation don’t come with any password. <br>
  after that you may see something similar in your command prompt which confirms you are in a track.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
